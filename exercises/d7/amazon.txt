farther down the rabbit hole ....


1. 	A. user searching, searching probably should be a its own model...
		something like /search/body="baseball glove"
	B. to find item price 
		/item/price/1 (for item one)
	C. quanity of an item in a cart
		/cart/item_id=1/quantity

2. A. User_controller
   B. Item_controller
   C. Cart_controller

this should generally correlate with a resource but there a re times when the full functionality of a resource is not required

3.  A. should show an idex of differnt items, a list, because a seach 		should try to return more than one item. 	
	B. This should be a show, with the parameter of price which should be included in each instance of item
	C. This should also return an index because the cart could have more than one item in it.
